# Project: Integrating AI into the Testing Process ðŸ¤–

## Description 
Develop a prototype of a system that uses artificial intelligence to automate web application testing. The system should automatically generate test scripts based on an analysis of the application's structure and functionality, evaluate their effectiveness, and identify potential errors.

### Keywords
- Analysis of the structure and functionality of a web application for generating test scenarios.
- Development of an algorithm for automatic test scenario generation.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of the generated test scenarios and identification of potential errors.
- Integration of the system with the web application for testing.
